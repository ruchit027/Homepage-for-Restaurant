# Homepage-for-Restaurant
I developed this Homepage for Restaurant using HTML , CSS and Bootstrap .

> HTML:  HTML stands for Hyper Text  Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.

> CSS: Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page.

> BOOTSTRAP: Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets,  and Phones). All thanks to Bootstrap developers – Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it was later declared to be an open-source project.

> Approach: First create the HTML structure and then add title for the webpage and link external CSS files (`style.css` and Bootstrap).
> Utilize Bootstrap Navbar for a responsive navigation bar and include a brand/logo and navigation links for different sections.
> Create a <section> for a welcoming message and apply Bootstrap styling classes and alignment also integrate a call-to-action button for reservations.
> Divide the page into sections for About, Carousel, and Reservation by using Bootstrap grid system for layout and design.
> Implement an image slider with Bootstrap Carousel component.
> Develop a simple footer with a copyright notice.Use Bootstrap’s `text-center` class for center alignment.
